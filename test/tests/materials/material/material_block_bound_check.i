# This is a simple test of the Material System. A
# user-defined Material (MTMaterial) is providing a
# Real property named "matp" that varies spatially
# throughout the domain. This property is used as a
# coefficient by MatDiffusion.
#
# This test verifies that when a material is restricted
# to a boundary, that MOOSE correctly reports that the
# volumetric material is missing.
