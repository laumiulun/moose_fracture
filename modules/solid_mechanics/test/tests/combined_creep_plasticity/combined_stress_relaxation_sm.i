#
# 1x1x1 unit cube with constant displacement on top face
#
# This problem was taken from "Finite element three-dimensional elastic-plastic
#    creep analysis" by A. Levy, Eng. Struct., 1981, Vol. 3, January, pp. 9-16.
#
# The problem is a one-dimensional creep analysis.  The top face is displaced 0.01
#    units and held there.  The stress relaxes in time according to the creep law.
#
# The analytic solution to this problem is (contrary to what is shown in the paper):
#
#                /       (E*ef)^3     \^(1/3)
#    stress_yy = |--------------------|
#                \ 3*a*E^4*ef^3*t + 1 /
#
#    where E  = 2.0e11  (Young's modulus)
#          a  = 3e-26  (creep coefficient)
#          ef = 0.01   (displacement)
#          t  = 2160.0    (time)
#
#    such that the analytical solution is computed to be 2.9518e3 Pa
#
# Averaged over the single element block, MOOSE calculates the stress in the yy direction to be
#     to be 3.046e3 Pa, which is a 3.2% error from the analytical solution.
