/**
 * Base class for capillary pressure for multiphase flow in porous media. To implement
 * an effective saturation formulation, override effectiveSaturation() and derivatives.
 * To implement a capillary pressure curve that will include the logarithmic extension,
 * override capillaryPressureCurve() and derivatives.
 *
 * Note: Capillary pressure is calculated as a function of true saturation, not
 * effective saturation (saturation minus residual). Derivatives are returned wrt
 * true saturation, so no scaling of them is required in objects using these methods.
 *
 * Includes an optional logarithmic extension in the low saturation region where
 * capillary pressure can go to infinity as saturation tends to 0. Calculation of
 * logarithmic extension from Webb, A simple extension of two-phase characteristic
 * curves to include the dry region, Water Resources Research 36, 1425-1430 (2000)
