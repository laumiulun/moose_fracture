## MooseDocs Configuration File
Before discussing the required configuration file, it is important to understand how the MooseDocs
system operates. The system relies heavily on the [python-markdown] package, which is a tool written
in [python] to convert from [markdown] syntax to [html]. For websites, the MooseDocs system simply
converts all [markdown] files (those with a *.md extension) automatically, in parallel, using
[python-markdown]. For [presentation](moose_docs/presentation.md) and [pdf](moose_docs/pdf.md)
creation, the conversion only acts on a specified, single markdown file.

For all conversion types, a list of [python-markdown
extensions](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/index.html) must be provided. A detailed
description of the extensions is provided on the [MOOSE
markdown](moose_docs/moose_markdown/index.md) pages. This is done via a configuration file, which is
nothing more than a list of extensions and extension configuration options needed to convert from
markdown to the desired format. The configuration file is written using [YAML] format.
