# Crack Data Sampler
!syntax description /VectorPostprocessors/CrackDataSampler

This object is used to report the values of the set of fracture domain integrals computed by independent Postprocessors along the crack front as a vector of values, along with the position along the crack front, expressed either as a distance or an angle. This object is typically not defined by a user, but is set up automatically using a [DomainIntegralAction](/DomainIntegralAction.md).
