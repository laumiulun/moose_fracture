# MeshSideSet
!syntax description /MeshModifiers/MeshSideSet

Element sides are not explicitly meshed in MOOSE/libmesh, i.e. no shape functions
live on the lower dimensional sides. To run kernels on lower dimensional manifolds
they need to be explicitly meshed. That can be accomplished in a mesh generation
tool like Cubit, or using this MeshModifier.

In 3D simulations the appropriate 2D elements (And for 2D simulations 1D elements)
will be meshed in at selected side sets (boundaries). The choice of lower dimensional
side elements is dictated by the higher dimensional volume element types.

## Coupling between side and volume meshes

The newly generated lower dimensional side elements will share nodes with the higher
dimensional volumes elements. Coupling to the variables from volume elements in
"just works".

Coupling in the other direction is not as straight forward. The lower dimensional
variables exist on some nodes of the adjacent volume elements. The volume kernels
will run on the volume quadrature points at which _tapered off_ values from the
adjacent edges van be found. Use at your own risk.
