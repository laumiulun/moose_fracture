# TimeStepper System
The method used to calculate the size of the time steps is controlled by the
`TimeStepper` block. There are a number of types of TimeStepper available, each
of which controls the time stepping in different ways, including using fixed
time stepping, time stepping based on a function, or adaptive time stepping.
