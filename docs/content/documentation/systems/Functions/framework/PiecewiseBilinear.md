# PiecewiseBilinear
!syntax description /Functions/PiecewiseBilinear

## Description

The `PiecewiseBilinear` function reads a csv file and interpolates values based on the
data in the file.  The interpolation is based on x-y pairs.  If `axis` is given, time is
used as the y index.  Either `xaxis` or `yaxis` or both may be given.  Time is used as
the other index if one of them is not given.  If `radius` is given, `xaxis` and `yaxis`
are used to orient a cylindrical coordinate system, and the x-y pair used in the query
will be the radial coordinate and time.
