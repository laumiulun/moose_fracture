# ComputeCrackTipEnrichmentSmallStrain
The displacement field contains both the standard and the enrichment solution. The `ComputeCrackTipEnrichmentSmallStrain` Material calculates the strains from the total displacement field, including the contributions from both the standard and enrichment solution. This is a drop-in replacement for the standard strain calculators, and is applicable only to small-strain problems.
